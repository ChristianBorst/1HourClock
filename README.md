# 1 Hour Clock
##A Three.js application that draws a minimalistic 1-hour clock.

This project was meant to be an introduction to Three.js and then thrown away.
Fortunately I really liked the elegance of the result, and put some considerable work into it.

This project taught me the basics of Three.js rendering and looping.
